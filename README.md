## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
I learnt the skill of problem solving and debugging. The act of tasking my brain into manipulating was something I discovered during this challenge. Below are some codes I found very pleasing

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
.heading {
    font-family: 'Big Shoulders Display', cursive;
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    color: hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75);
}
```

### Continued development
 - Media queries
 - CSS positioning
 - Flexbox and CSS Grid

### Useful resources

- [CSS Button generator](https://css3buttongenerator.com) - This helped me create the CSS code for the buttons needed in the website by specifying the features and details I wanted. I really liked the ease that came with it and will use it going forward.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This is an amazing website that helped in understanding the concepts of fonts and their families
- [MDN font-weight documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) - This article which helped me finally understand the concepts of font weights. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
